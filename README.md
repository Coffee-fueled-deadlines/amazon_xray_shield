# Amazon Xray Shield
---

If you're like me and found yourself struggling with the X-ray Feature on Amazon Prime Video and simply wished it wasn't there, this plugin is for you.  It does what should be already exist and simply removes it within 10 seconds of the video starting.  The code is very simple and seems to get the job done.
